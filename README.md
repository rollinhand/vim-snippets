# vim-snippets
This repository contains a collection of snippets for VIM which
can be used by [snipMate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate) plugin.
The original repositories are added as submodules to keep them in sync on
updates.

## Usage
Repositories can be updated using `bootstrap.sh` in the root directory. This
script also merges all snippets to `vim/snippets`. This directory can be copied
to your local VIM installation `.vim/snippets` where they can be found by
snipMate.
